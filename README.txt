Week 4 - Assignment II
Doing the test while trying to find 50'000.000 names we can see how there's an average difference of 10 seconds between each implementation. 
How was expected the hash search is several times faster than the List for this case. Because with the hash we are accessing the registers by a key directly but
with the list we iterate all over it before finding a register (if it's not there that's even worst), losing precious time.
